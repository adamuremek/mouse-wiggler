# Mouse Wiggler (For Teams :P)
## About
This is a script that you can run in the background of a computer running teams that will keep you active by wiggling your mouse time to time.
The mouse moves by only 1 unit (be it a pixel or a float based unit) and you can still use the mouse normally if you need to while the script is active.

## Setup
    1. CD to the project root directory
    2. Create a virutal environment: `python -m venv <venv-name>`
    3. Activate virtual environment
    4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    5. Run main.py
